All terms and points are covered here in a way I understood it.

#                    Network Design
Tier 2 network - Access and Distribution layer
Tier 3 network - Access, Distribution and Core layer
Access layer - devices, L2 switches
Distribution layer - SVIs, East-West traffic, sometimes L3 interfaces
Core layer - high-speed, high-convergence, high-throughput, access to Internet

#                    High availability (HA)
VRRP - virtual gateway protocol. 2+ gateways. Can't load balance. Common on all devices.
HSRP - Cisco proprietary VRRP implementation. 2+ gateways
GLBP - Load balancing mechanism (Cisco proprietary). Similar to HSRP, but supports no less than 4 gateways
SSO - mechanism that allows second CPU to take over the traffic and processing from other CPU in case of it's failure
VSS - stacking mechanism that allows two physical switches to be represented as a single virtual switch. Devices can be located in remote locations

#                    SD-WAN
SDN (Software-Defined Network) - network that is managed in a centralized way (though a controller or using scripts)
SD-WAN  is an SDN applier to devices related to WAN (edge router for example)

SD-WAN  is separated into 4 planes (Orchestration, Management, Control and Data)
Usually Control and Data plane are both living on same device.
In case of SD-WAN (and SDN), controller is responsible for Control Plane (brain of network). Edge devices are responsible for Data plane (legs of network).

Differences:
WAN                                                             |   SD-WAN
________________________________________________________________|__________________________________________________________________________
Each device has own control plane                               |   Centralized control plane
All configuration, upgrades and monitoring done on each box     |   Configuration, upgrades and monitoring done centralized
Automation only through scripts                                 |   Automation can be done using API or scripts
New installation done from scratch                              |   New installation can be done with help of ZTP (Zero-Touch Provisioning)

#                    SD-Access
SDN applied to Access layer of network.

SDN implementation and effect upon planes:
Imperative approach - Only controller has control plane. In case devices loose connectivity to controller - they're dead since no decision can be made
Declarative approach - Devices has their own control plane which replicate the state from controller. In case connectivity to controller is lost, devices can handle traffic on their own

Fabric border device - Core
Fabric intermediate device - Distribution
Fabric edge device - Access

#                    QoS (Quality of service)
QoS - allows the manipulation of traffic (packets) in a way to prioritize some important data to be transfered with better confidions (sometimes be transferred at all - in case bandwidth of an interface is lower that the amount of traffic)

QoS tools:
1. Classification & Marking - used for ingress traffic. Packets get classified (by source, destination IP, protocol, ports) and marked on ingress interface with certain priority for egress interface to understand how it should be forwarded. NBAR (Network-Based Application Recognition) exists which lets the classification to happen with more details (based on word, phrase or URL for example)
2. Policing - used on ingress interface (provide edge interface facing customer edge device) to drop all the traffic that exceeds the configured policing bandwidth. Can be configured for different types of traffic (TCP, UDP, DNS, other apps.)
3. Shaping - used on egress interface to create queues (queueing) which allows traffic that exceeds the configured bandwidth to be sent later, whenever the circuit is less busy. 
4. Queueing - used on egress interface to divide egress queue on sub-queues
5. Scheduling - used to empty the sub-queues in a certain way.

Congestion management - a set of tools (egress interface) that manages happened congestion. WFQ, CBWFQ, PQ, LLQ, WRR, SRR, Shaping.
Congestion avoidance - a set of tools (ingress interface) that prevents congestions from happening. RED, WRED, WTD, Policing.

#                    STP (Spanning-tree protocol)
STP (802.1D) - protocol that allows switches to become aware of other switches through advertising and receiving of BPDUs. Also build loop-free topology
BPDU - Bridge Protocol Data Unit

STP port states:
Disabled - Port is admin down
Blocking - Port cannot forward network traffic. Can receive BPDUs
Listening - Can't forward network traffic. Can receive and forward BPDUs
Learning - Can't forward network traffic. Can receive and send BPDUs and alter MAC address table based on received network traffic 
Forwarding - Port operates as usual
Broken - Port discards packets while issue exists
