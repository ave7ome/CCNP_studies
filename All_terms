Tier 2 network - Access and Distribution layer
Tier 3 network - Access, Distribution and Core layer
Access layer - devices, L2 switches
Distribution layer - SVIs, East-West traffic, sometimes L3 interfaces
Core layer - high-speed, high-convergence, high-throughput, access to Internet

High availability (HA)
VRRP - virtual gateway protocol. 2+ gateways. Can't load balance. Common on all devices.
HSRP - Cisco proprietary VRRP implementation. 2+ gateways
GLBP - Load balancing mechanism (Cisco proprietary). Similar to HSRP, but supports no less than 4 gateways
SSO - mechanism that allows second CPU to take over the traffic and processing from other CPU in case of it's failure

CEF
Process Switching

CAM
TCAM
FIB
RIB
Adjacency table
RP (route processor)
SSO (stateful switchover)
------------
STP (802.1D) - protocol that allows switches to become aware of other switches through advertising and receiving of BPDUs. Also build loop-free topology
BPDU - Bridge Protocol Data Unit

STP port states:
Disabled - Port is admin down
Blocking - Port cannot forward network traffic. Can receive BPDUs
Listening - Can't forward network traffic. Can receive and forward BPDUs
Learning - Can't forward network traffic. Can receive and send BPDUs and alter MAC address table based on received network traffic 
Forwarding - Port operates as usual
Broken - Port discards packets while issue exists
