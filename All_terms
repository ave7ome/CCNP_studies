All terms and points are covered here in a way I understood it.

Tier 2 network - Access and Distribution layer
Tier 3 network - Access, Distribution and Core layer
Access layer - devices, L2 switches
Distribution layer - SVIs, East-West traffic, sometimes L3 interfaces
Core layer - high-speed, high-convergence, high-throughput, access to Internet

High availability (HA)
VRRP - virtual gateway protocol. 2+ gateways. Can't load balance. Common on all devices.
HSRP - Cisco proprietary VRRP implementation. 2+ gateways
GLBP - Load balancing mechanism (Cisco proprietary). Similar to HSRP, but supports no less than 4 gateways
SSO - mechanism that allows second CPU to take over the traffic and processing from other CPU in case of it's failure

SD-WAN
SDN (Software-Defined Network) - network that is managed in a centralized way (though a controller or using scripts)
SD-WAN  is an SDN applier to devices related to WAN (edge router for example)

SD-WAN  is separated into 4 planes (Orchestration, Management, Control and Data)
Usually Control and Data plane are both living on same device.
In case of SD-WAN (and SDN), controller is responsible for Control Plane (brain of network). Edge devices are responsible for Data plane (legs of network).

Differences:
WAN                                                             |   SD-WAN
________________________________________________________________|__________________________________________________________________________
Each device has own control plane                               |   Centralized control plane
All configuration, upgrades and monitoring done on each box     |   Configuration, upgrades and monitoring done centralized
Automation only through scripts                                 |   Automation can be done using API or scripts
New installation done from scratch                              |   New installation can be done with help of ZTP (Zero-Touch Provisioning)

CAM
TCAM
FIB
RIB
Adjacency table
RP (route processor)
SSO (stateful switchover)
------------
STP (802.1D) - protocol that allows switches to become aware of other switches through advertising and receiving of BPDUs. Also build loop-free topology
BPDU - Bridge Protocol Data Unit

STP port states:
Disabled - Port is admin down
Blocking - Port cannot forward network traffic. Can receive BPDUs
Listening - Can't forward network traffic. Can receive and forward BPDUs
Learning - Can't forward network traffic. Can receive and send BPDUs and alter MAC address table based on received network traffic 
Forwarding - Port operates as usual
Broken - Port discards packets while issue exists
