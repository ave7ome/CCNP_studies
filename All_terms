#                    Network Design
Tier 2 network - Access and Distribution layer
Tier 3 network - Access, Distribution and Core layer
Collapsed topology - can be collapsed in following ways:
    Core-Distribution (2 modules), Distribution-Access (2 modules), Core-Distribution-Access (1 module)

L2 Access layer:
    STP have to be considered - links will be blocked (solution - PVST+ or assigning certain VLANs to certain links with no loops)
L3 Access layer:
    Costs more money but STP and Loops are not an issue anymore. Also can't easily stretch the VLAN

Modern techs to get rid of STP:
    Chassis switches (prevents loops, and no single point of failure)
    Stacking (prevents loops, and no single point of failure)

Access layer - devices, L2 switches
    Port security - MACs, 802.1x;
    QoS;
    VLAN tagging.
Distribution layer - SVIs, East-West traffic, sometimes L3 interfaces
    SVIs;
    FHRPs;
    ACLs;
    Routing protocols.
Core layer - high-speed, high-convergence, high-throughput, access to Internet
    RPs;
    fast l3 switching

DC new cool topology:
    Spine-Leaf

#                    High availability (HA)
VRRP - virtual gateway protocol. 2+ gateways. Can't load balance. Common on all devices.
HSRP - Cisco proprietary VRRP implementation. 2+ gateways
GLBP - Load balancing mechanism (Cisco proprietary). Similar to HSRP, but supports no less than 4 gateways
SSO - mechanism that allows second CPU to take over the traffic and processing from other CPU in case of it's failure
VSS - stacking mechanism that allows two physical switches to be represented as a single virtual switch. Devices can be located in remote locations

#                    SD-WAN
SDN (Software-Defined Network) - network that is managed in a centralized way (though a controller or using scripts)
SD-WAN  is an SDN applier to devices related to WAN (edge router for example)

SD-WAN  is separated into 4 planes (Orchestration, Management, Control and Data)
Usually Control and Data plane are both living on same device.
In case of SD-WAN (and SDN), controller is responsible for Control Plane (brain of network). Edge devices are responsible for Data plane (legs of network).

Differences:
WAN                                                             |   SD-WAN
________________________________________________________________|__________________________________________________________________________
Each device has own control plane                               |   Centralized control plane
All configuration, upgrades and monitoring done on each box     |   Configuration, upgrades and monitoring done centralized
Automation only through scripts                                 |   Automation can be done using API or scripts
New installation done from scratch                              |   New installation can be done with help of ZTP (Zero-Touch Provisioning)

#                    SD-Access
SDN applied to Access layer of network.

SDN implementation and effect upon planes:
Imperative approach - Only controller has control plane. In case devices loose connectivity to controller - they're dead since no decision can be made
Declarative approach - Devices has their own control plane which replicate the state from controller. In case connectivity to controller is lost, devices can handle traffic on their own

Fabric border device - Core
Fabric intermediate device - Distribution
Fabric edge device - Access

#                    QoS (Quality of service)
QoS - allows the manipulation of traffic (packets) in a way to prioritize some important data to be transfered with better confidions (sometimes be transferred at all - in case bandwidth of an interface is lower that the amount of traffic)

QoS tools:
1. Classification & Marking - used for ingress traffic. Packets get classified (by source, destination IP, protocol, ports) and marked on ingress interface with certain priority for egress interface to understand how it should be forwarded. 
    NBAR (Network-Based Application Recognition) exists which lets the classification to happen with more details (based on word, phrase or URL for example)
2. Policing - used on ingress interface (provide edge interface facing customer edge device) to drop all the traffic that exceeds the configured policing bandwidth. Can be configured for different types of traffic (TCP, UDP, DNS, other apps.)
3. Shaping - used on egress interface to create queues (queueing) which allows traffic that exceeds the configured bandwidth to be sent later, whenever the circuit is less busy. 
4. Queueing - used on egress interface to divide egress queue on sub-queues
5. Scheduling - used to empty the sub-queues in a certain way.

Congestion management - a set of tools (egress interface) that manages happened congestion. WFQ, CBWFQ, PQ, LLQ, WRR, SRR, Shaping.
Congestion avoidance - a set of tools (ingress interface) that prevents congestions from happening. RED, WRED, WTD, Policing.

QoS application in Network:
Integrated services - unified settings on all the routers on the way. Uses RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol).
Differentiated services - each router has it's own settings. Uses PHB (Per-Hop Behaviour).

QoS Policies
Before all QoS settings had to be applied to interfaces.
Now QoS settings are applied globally. Interfaces are used to display the direction of traffic for QoS to be applied.

MQS (Modular QoS Command-Line):
QoS applied globally.
Allows for different QoS tools to be applied to different interfaces.
3 components:
  Class-map - used to match certain type of traffic and classify it
  Policy-map - used to match certain traffic classified by class-maps. To initiate the use of class-maps
  Service-policy - used to apply a policy-map to interface. Inbound/Outbound.
  
1. Traffic from 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.1.1 is matched and classified by class-map.
2. Policy-map initiates the class-map and makes the classified traffic to follow the specified rules. Apply policing for all the traffic from 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.1.1 (from gi0/1 to gi0/3) to prevent it from congesting the interface gi0/1.
3. Apply service-policy to interface gi0/1 (inbound) and interface gi0/3 (outbout) to use the above rules for this traffic.

#                    Network device architecture
Process Switching - old intra-device frame/packet switching mechanism. Every frame/packet received by device is forwarded to CPU for it to lookup the MAC / Routing table and decide where Data unit should be egressed.

RIB - a "Database" of all the information about learned routes on the device. Routing Table includes a formatted data taken from RIB.
CEF (Cisco Express Forwarding) - Cisco proprietary mechanism for DataUnit switching. After packet was once forwarded through CPU, same source/destination combination will not be forwarded to CPU anymore and will just be egresses to the same interface as before. Data for that is stored in FIB (network - network mask - egress interface)
In recent CEF implementations, all the FIB data is collected beforehand from RIB.
CEF establishes an area (Cached area) that stores pre-defined decisions for packet switching.
CEF consists of FIB and Adjacency table.

FIB - database of all the routes in a compact format (network - network mask - egress interface)

Adjacency table - an L2 information with MAC-addresses for packet to be reincapsulated into a new frame (with new source and destination MACs) while forwarding.

https://linkmeup.ru/podcasts/959/ --- CEF, Process Switching deep dive

CAM - located in a RAM. Contains the information about MAC addresses of devices in subnets. MACs are represented as MAC-addrrss table. Can only be used by switches
TCAM - located in RAM. Contains IP-addresses and subnet masks. Provides as assistance with decision of best path based on longest match (/30 mask is longer match than /24). Subnets and masks are represented as Routing table. Can be used by routers and multilayer switches.
RP (route processor)

#                    Virtualization
#        ENDPOINT VIRTUALIZATION 
Hypervisor - a utility that allows management and provides visibility of Guest OSes (VMs)
Type 1 hypervisor - a hypervisor that is installed directly on Hardware (HW --- Hypervisor --- VMs)
Type 2 hypervisor - a hypervisor that is installed on some OS like Microsoft Windows (HW --- OS --- Hypervisor --- VMS)

Virtual Switch (vSwitch) - literally a virtual switch  that connects it's virtual interfaces (ports) to VNICs distributed to running VMs. 
vSwitch can distiribute certain connected devices to their own broadcast domains ("VLANs"), this function is represented by port-groups.
Virtual Switches exist on type1 Hypervisors by default (ESXi vSwitch, Microsoft Hyper-V)

#        DATA PATH VIRTUALIZATION
VRF - A technology that allows router (or Multilayer device) to logically be divided into few other routers.
Each VRF will have their own routing table (for example that allows few similar subnets to be defined and reachable.
Usually used in ISP networks therefore requires ISP networks (MPLS, VPN, L3VPN, BGP).

VRF-Lite - an Enterprise solution that allows routing to be done through common routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP). No extra VPN protocols required.


#                    STP (Spanning-tree protocol)
https://linkmeup.ru/podcasts/977/
STP (802.1D) - protocol that allows switches to become aware of other switches through advertising and receiving of BPDUs. Also build loop-free topology
BPDU - Bridge Protocol Data Unit

STP port states:
Disabled - Port is admin down
Blocking - Port cannot forward network traffic. Can receive BPDUs
Listening - Can't forward network traffic. Can receive and forward BPDUs
Learning - Can't forward network traffic. Can receive and send BPDUs and alter MAC address table based on received network traffic 
Forwarding - Port operates as usual
Broken - Port discards packets while issue exists
